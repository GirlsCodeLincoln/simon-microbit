# Simon for Micro:bits

Memorization game, Simon, made for Micro:bits! Live demo located on the [Microbits official editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/_4CK3sfK7P81L). This code was created for the Girls Code Lincoln Spring 2019 Intermediate Code Club.

Start the game by pressing A+B simultaneously on the Micro:bit. The board will then show you a sequence of A's and B's, and prompt the player to repeat the sequence back using the A and B buttons.
